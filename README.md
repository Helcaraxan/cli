pipelines and builds. Integrates seamlessly with Github / Gitlab / Bitbucket.

## Usage

```bash

## Development

Developed using Golang 1.11+ with modules.

```
export GO111MODULE=on
git clone git@github.com:buildkite/cli.git
cd cli/
go run ./cmd/bk --help
```

## Design

### Secret Storage

`bk` needs several sets of credentials to operate (aws, buildkite, and github/gitlab/bithucket), all of which need to be stored securely on your local machine. We use 99design's [keyring](https://github.com/99designs/keyring) to store the credentials in your operating system's native secure store. On macOS this is Keychain.
